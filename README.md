### Personal Development 

I am busy on a journey to improve my typing skills. I never invested the time into touch typing and have been on a personal journey to correct this.
I've currently transitioned to touch typing, and you can read more about it [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/learning-type-like-noob-oliver-rivett-carnac/?trackingId=z5ZAsOTJ6h5%2FMF%2FmzADOoA%3D%3D).
